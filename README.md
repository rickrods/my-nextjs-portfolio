## ⭐ Features
- Displays your GitHub profile, organizations, and repositories for one or two linked accounts
- Resolves the active GitHub usernames from personal access tokens in [.env.local](.env.local), so sensitive profile values are no longer stored in public config
- Supports a secondary account with its own description, featured repositories, and hidden repositories
- Shows project stats, traffic data, and security alerts when available
- Includes Vercel deployment information and framework detection
- Supports a simple search experience for browsing other GitHub users

## 💻 Running locally

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rickrods/My-Portfolio-App.git
cd My-Portfolio-App
```

Add your tokens to [.env.local](.env.local):

```sh
# Required for build-time GitHub data requests
GH_TOKEN=YOUR_GH_TOKEN

# Optional, enables a secondary GitHub profile and repository set
SECONDARY_GH_TOKEN=YOUR_SECONDARY_GH_TOKEN

# Optional for Vercel deployment information
VC_TOKEN=YOUR_VERCEL_TOKEN
```

`GH_TOKEN` is required for the app to build and run successfully. `SECONDARY_GH_TOKEN` is optional and enables the secondary account experience.

#### 📝 Configuration
- The app retrieves the GitHub usernames, avatars, display names, and bio from the github api using the configured github personal access token environment variables.
- The app will retrieve the bio from the github account and use this if `description` and `secondaryDescription` are null. If `description` and `secondaryDescription` are filled in the application will use this data instead of the github bio.
- Use `projects` and `secondaryProjects` to feature certain repositories and hide others from the portfolio.

```json
{
  "description": "Description for the primary GitHub account",
  "projects": {
    "blacklist": ["repo-to-hide-1", "repo-to-hide-2"],
    "heroNames": ["featured-repo-1", "featured-repo-2"]
  },
  "secondaryDescription": "Description for the secondary GitHub account",
  "secondaryProjects": {
    "blacklist": ["secondary-repo-to-hide-1"],
    "heroNames": ["secondary-featured-repo-1"]
  }
}
```
